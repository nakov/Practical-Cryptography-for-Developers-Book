# Preface

...

Most books about cryptography are written either in too **academic style** with a lot of theory, like [http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/).

...

Others are too old: ...

Others are not bad, but not free:

Crypto libraries come with limited and not consistently organized documentation, e.g. the Crypto++ Wiki [https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Main\_page](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Main_page).

...

Now I am happy to publish a **developer-friendly practical cryptography book**.** **It holds just **what developers need to know** in order to **use cryptography in their every day work**. It does not cover the internals of the algortithms and how to design symmetric ciphers or authentication algorithms. It covers the basic understanding of the **core cryptographic concepts** and how to use them: **libraries, tools, code examples**.

...

The book author **Svetlin Nakov** is involved with applied cryptography from 2005, when he published the book "Java for Digitally Signing Documents of the Web" \(in Bulgarian\), following his master thesis on a similar topic.

...

It is not required to be strong mathematician to understand the cryptographic concepts from developer perspective. This book will teach you the basic concepts is almost math-free style.
