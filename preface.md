# Preface

Most books about cryptography are written either in too **academic style** with a lot of theory, like the [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/).

Others are not bad, but not free:

* [The Modern Cryptography CookBook](https://leanpub.com/crypto)
* [Cryptography for Developers](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Developers-Tom-St-Denis/dp/1597491047)

Crypto libraries come with limited and not consistently organized documentation, e.g. the Crypto++ Wiki [https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Main\_page](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Main_page%29%29%29\).

Now I am happy to publish a **developer-friendly practical cryptography book**.** **It holds just **what developers need to know** in order to **use cryptography in their every day work**. It does not cover the internals of the algortithms and how to design symmetric ciphers or authentication algorithms. It covers the basic understanding of the **core cryptographic concepts** and how to use them: **libraries, tools, code examples**.

The book author **Svetlin Nakov** is involved with applied cryptography since 2005, when he published the book "Java for Digitally Signing Documents of the Web" \(in Bulgarian\), following his master thesis on a similar topic.

It is not required to be a strong mathematician to understand the cryptographic concepts from a developer's perspective. This book will teach you the basic concepts is almost math-free style.
