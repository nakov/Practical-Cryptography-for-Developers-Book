# Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange

## Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange \(DHKE\)

[**Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange) \(DHKE\) is a cryptographic method to **securely exchange cryptographic keys** \(key agreement protocol\) over a public \(insecure\) channel in a way that overheard communication does not reveal the keys. The exchanged keys are used later for encrypted communication \(e.g. using a symmetric cipher like AES\).

**DHKE** was one of the first **public-key protocols**, which allows two parties to exchange data securely, so that is someone sniffs the communication between the parties, the information exchanged can be revealed.

The Diffie–Hellman \(DH\) method is **anonymous key agreement scheme**: it allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a **shared secret key over an insecure channel**.

Note that the DHKE method is **resistant to** [**sniffing attacks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack) \(data interception\), but it is vulnerable to [**man-in-the-middle attacks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) \(attacker secretly relays and possibly **alters the communication** between two parties\).

The **Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange** protocol can be implemented using **discrete logarithms** \(the classical [**DHKE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange) algorithm\) or using **elliptic-curve cryptography** \(the [**ECDH**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman) algorithm\).

### Key Exchange by Mixing Colors

The Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange protocol is very similar to the concept of "**key exchanging by mixing colors**", which has a good visual representation, which simplifies its understanding. This is why we shall first explain how to exchange a secret color by **color mixing**.

The design of color mixing key exchange scheme assumes that if we have two liquids of different colors, we can **easily mix the colors** and obtain a new color, but the reverse operation is almost impossible: **no way to separate the mixed colors** back to their original color components.

This is the color exchange **scenario**, step by step:

* **Alice** and **Bob**, agree on an arbitrary **starting \(shared\) color** that does not need to be kept secret \(e.g. _yellow_\).
* **Alice** and **Bob** separately select a **secret color** that they keep to themselves \(e.g. _red_ and _sea green_\).
* Finally **Alice** and **Bob** **mix** their secret color together with their mutually shared color. The obtained mixed colors area ready for public exchange \(in our case _orange_ and _light sky blue_\).

The next steps in the color exchanging scenario are as follows:

* **Alice** and **Bob** publicly **exchange** their two **mixed colors**.
  * We assume that there is no efficient way to extract \(separate\) the secret color from the mixed color, so third parties who know the mixed colors cannot reveal the secret colors.
* Finally, **Alice** and **Bob** mix together the color they received from the partner with their own secret color.
  * The result is the **final color mixture** \(_yellow-brown_\) which is identical to the partner's color mixture.
  * It is the **securely exchanged shared key**.

If a third parties have intercepted the color exchanging process, it would be computationally difficult for them to determine the secret colors.

The **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** protocol is based on similar concept, but uses [**discrete logarithms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) and [**modular exponentiations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation) instead of color mixing.

## The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange \(DHKE\) Protocol

Now, let's explain how the **DHKE** protocol works.

### The Math behind DHKE

**DHKE** is based on a simple property of [**modular exponentiations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation):

\(**ga**\)**b** mod **p** = \(**gb**\)**a** mod **p**

where **g**, **a**, **b** and **p** are positive integers.

If we have **A** = **ga** mod **p** and **B** = **gb** mod **p**, we can calculate **gab** mod **p**, without revealing **a** or **b** \(which are called **secret exponents**\).

In computing theory, these is no efficient algorithm which can find a secret exponent. If we have **m**, **g** and **p** from the below equation:

**m** = **gs** mod **p**

there is no efficient \(fast\) algorithm to find the secret exponent **s**. This is known as the [Discrete Logartihm Problem \(DLP\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_%28DLP%29).

### Discrete Logarithm Problem \(DLP\)

The **Discrete Logarithm Problem \(DLP\)** in computer science is defined as follows:

* By given element _**b**_ and value _**a**_ = _**b<sup>x<sup>**_ find the exponent _**x**_ \(if it exists\)

The exponent _**x**_ is called [**discrete logarithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm), i.e. **x** = _log_**b**\(**a**\). The elements _**a**_ and _**b**_ can be simple integers modulo _**p**_ \(from the [group ℤ/pℤ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n)\) or elements of [finite cyclic multiplicative group **G**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group) \(modulo _**p**_\), where _**p**_ is typically a prime number.

In cryptography, many algorithms rely on the **computational difficulty of the DLP problem** over carefully chosen group, for which **no efficient algorithm exists**.

### The DHKE Protocol

Now, after we are familiar with the above mathematical properties of the modular exponentiations, we are ready to explain **the DHKE protocol**. This is how it works:

![](../.gitbook/assets/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-protocol.png)

Let's explain each step of this key-exchange process:

* Alice and Bob agree to use two public integers: **modulus p** and **base g** \(where **p** is [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), and **g** is a [primitive root modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n) **p**\).
  * For example, let **p** = 23 and **g** = 5.
  * The integers **g** and **p** are public, typically hard-coded constants in the source code.
* Alice chooses a **secret integer a** \(e.g. **a** = 4\), then calculates and sends to Bob the number **A = ga mod p**.
  * The number **A** is public. It is sent over the public channel and its interception cannot reveal the secret exponent **a**.
  * In our case we have: **A** = 54 mod 23 = 4.
* Bob chooses a **secret integer b** \(e.g. **b** = 3\), then calculates and sends to Alice the number **B = gb mod p**.
  * In our case we have: **B** = 53 mod 23 = 10
* Alice computes s = Ba mod p
  * In our example: **s** = 104 mod 23 = **18**
* Bob computes s = Ab mod p
  * In our example: **s** = 43 mod 23 = **18**
* Alice and Bob now share a **secret number s**
  * **s** = Ab mod p = Ba mod p = \(ga\)b mod p = \(gb\)a mod p = gab mod p = **18**
  * The shared secret key **s** cannot be computed from the publicly available numbers **A** and **B**, because the secret exponents **a** and **b** cannot be efficiently calculated.

In the most common implementation of DHKE \(following the [RFC 3526](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3526)\) the base is **g** = **2** and the modulus **p** is a large **prime number** \(1536 ... 8192 bits\).

### Security of the DHKE Protocol

The DHKE protocol is based on the practical difficulty of the [Diffie–Hellman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_problem), which is a variant of the well known in the computer science [DLP \(discrete logarithm problem\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Logarithm_Problem_%28DLP%29), for which no efficient algorithm still exists.

DHKE exchanges a **non-secret sequence of integer numbers** over insecure, public \(sniffable\) channel \(such as signal going through a cable or propagated by waves in the air\), but does not reveal the secretly-exchanged shared private key.

Again, be warned that DHKE protocol in its classical form is **vulnerable to** [**man-in-the-middle attacks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), where a hacker can intercept and modify the messages exchanged between the parties.

Finally, note that the integers **g**, **p**, **a** and **p** are typically very big numbers \(1024, 2048 or 4096 bits or even bigger\) and this makes the [**brute-force attacks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) non-sense.

### ECDH - Elliptic Curves-based Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol

The [**Elliptic-Curve Diffie–Hellman \(ECDH\)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman) is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an **elliptic-curve public–private key pair**, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

**ECDH** is a variant of the classical **DHKE** protocol, where the **modular exponentiation** calculations are replaced with **elliptic-curve** calculations for improved security. We shall explain in details the **elliptic-curve cryptography \(ECC\)** section later.
