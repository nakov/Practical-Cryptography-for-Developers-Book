# Practical Cryptography for Developers - Free Book by Svetlin Nakov

> **Warning**: this book is **not finished**! I am still working on some of the chapters. Once it is completed, I will publish it as PDF and EPUB. Be patient.

A modern **practical book** about **cryptography for developers** with code examples, covering core concepts like: **hashes **\(like SHA-3 and BLAKE2\), **MAC codes** \(like HMAC and GMAC\), **key derivation functions** \(like Scrypt, Argon2\), **key agreement protocols** \(like DHKE, ECDH\), **symmetric ciphers** \(like AES and ChaCha20, cipher block modes, authenticated encryption, AEAD, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305\), **asymmetric ciphers** and **public-key cryptosystems** \(RSA, ECC, ECIES\), **elliptic curve cryptography** \(ECC, secp256k1, curve25519\), **digital signatures** \(ECDSA and EdDSA\), **secure random numbers** \(PRNG, CSRNG\) and **quantum-safe cryptography**, along with crypto **libraries** and developer tools, with a lots of **code examples** in Python and other languages.
